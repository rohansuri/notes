### Abstract

* IPFS is a P2P distributed file system

* It models the data as a Merkle DAG which provides an infrastructure to build a versioned file system, blockchain and the permanent web upon.

* It combines the use of DHTs, incentivized block exchanges, self certifying namespaces.


### Introduction

* Aim of IPFS is to be a global distributed file system that is efficient in file distribution.

* BitTorrent is efficient and successful in file distribution, but wasn't created as an infrastructure piece to build upon.

* HTTP is the most successful "distributed system of files" ever deployed. It is the most adopted too, thanks to web browsers. 

  Caveat is it works well only for moving small files around.

* Use cases to handle "lots of data, accessible everywhere" have arised with Big Data computation, on-demand media streaming, etc.

* The aim is to make newer data distribution protocols part of the Web itself.

* Git heavily influences the design for them by offering a content addressed Merkle DAG data model.

### Addendum

#### Merkle DAG

#### Sybil attacks
